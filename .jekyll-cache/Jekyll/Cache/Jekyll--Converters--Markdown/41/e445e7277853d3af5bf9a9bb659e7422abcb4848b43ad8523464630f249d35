<h2 id="what-is-secret-rf">What is Secret Rf?</h2>

<p>Secret RF is a novel approach to deliver fractional radio frequency (RF) energy to all layers of the skin with minimal damage to the skinâ€™s surface. The multi-layered treatment is tailored to each individual and addresses their unique skin concern during each customized treatment.</p>

<h2 id="what-skin-conditions-does-it-treat">What skin conditions does it treat?</h2>

<p>The Secret RF treatment is ideal for improving aging skin, photodamage, fine lines and wrinkles on the face and neck, scars, acnes scars, skin quality and striae. The treatment is safe and effective, and suitable for all skin types and patients seeking skin revitalization.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Secret RF uses microneedles to deliver radio frequency energy into varying levels of the skin including the deeper layers where treatment is most beneficial. Unlike other devices which only deposit energy in upper layer of the skin, Secret RF de- livers RF energy below the surface where itâ€™s needed most to help revitalize and regenerate the tissue. This unique delivery of energy allows us to achieve optimal results with little to no downtime on all skin types.</p>
