<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-qualified-plastic-surgeon">How do I choose a qualified plastic surgeon?</h2>

<p>This is one of the most important questions you could ask. Your level of confidence in the doctor you choose is crucial. So please take all the time you need to carefully consider your options in deciding upon the plastic surgeon that is right for you. If you have questions or concerns after any office visit be sure to write them down and get them answered. Don‚Äôt feel awkward about getting a second opinion, especially when it comes to a plastic surgical procedure. Plastic surgery popularity has soared recently. More and more doctors are trying to get into the business. Any licensed physician (and even some dentists and chiropractors) can call themselves a ‚Äúcosmetic surgeon.‚Äù Please be sure and look past what they are describing themselves as and be critical of their credentials. Choosing a doctor that is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (R) (ASPS) is the first step in ensuring quality care and outcomes. Ask several of your friends and/or any nurse or medical practitioner you may know who they recommend. Also, if you have to wait before seeing your surgeon, be patient. Call early and plan ahead.
Here are a few very specific issues to look into the research before choosing your plastic surgeon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) ‚Äì the ONLY board recognized the the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in Plastic Surgery. Don‚Äôt be fooled by other ‚Äúboards‚Äù and ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù that are NOT recognized by the ABMS.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure your surgeon is a graduate of an accredited medical school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your surgeon has completed at least five years of surgical training after medical school with a minimum of two years in Plastic Surgery.</li>
  <li>Be certain your surgeon is trained and experienced in ALL plastic surgical procedures, including breast, body, face and reconstruction.</li>
  <li>Be certain your surgeon is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). Look for the symbol which is displayed on this website. The ASPS is the largest plastic surgery organization in the world.</li>
  <li>Operates only in accredited facilities. If you are having surgery (other than minor procedures) in someone‚Äôs office be certain to ask and confirm that facility‚Äôs accreditation.</li>
  <li>Has been granted privileges to perform the specific procedure you are interested by a hospital.</li>
  <li>Adheres to a strict code of ethics.</li>
  <li>Fulfills continuing medical education requirements. Also participates in maintenance of certification protocols as required by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</li>
</ul>
