<p>Facial lines and wrinkles occur despite our best efforts. Time, gravity, sun exposure are the primary culprits. Lines and wrinkles can typically be classified as dynamic or static. Dynamic lines occur due to excess muscle activity in the face, known as facial expression lines. Static lines are not necessarily due to excess muscle activity, but are essentially just there from one of the above causes. Botulinum toxin works by temporarily relaxing (weakening) muscles of the face. The most common areas that are treated are frown lines (between the eyebrows), forehead horizontal lines, crows feet lines and a few other not so common areas. Anyone with lines and wrinkles due to excess muscle activity may be considered a candidate for botulinum toxin injection. Botulinum toxin is manufactured under several names such as Botox¬Æ, Dysport¬Æ and Xeomin¬Æ.</p>

<p>Static facial lines and wrinkles are often times treated with injectable fillers. There are several different types of filler materials manufactured under different names. The most common fillers are made of hyaluronic acid. Some common trade names for this material are Juvederm¬Æ, Restylane¬Æ, Perlane¬Æ, and Boletero Balance¬Æ. This type of filler can be used to enhance lip volume, treat lines and wrinkles of the face, treat the nasolabial fold lines or any other common area of aging including soft tissue volume loss of the face. Another commonly used filler is call Radiesse¬Æ. Radiesse¬Æ is calcium hydroxylapatite. Radiesse¬Æ is used in the face in a similar fashion to other fillers with a few exceptions.</p>
