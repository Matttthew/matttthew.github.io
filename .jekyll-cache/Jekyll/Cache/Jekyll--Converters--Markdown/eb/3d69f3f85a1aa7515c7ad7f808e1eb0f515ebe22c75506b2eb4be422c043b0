<p>In general, two types of patients are candidates for reconstructive plastic surgery – those with congenital anomalies (including cleft lip, craniofacial anomalies, or hand deformities), and those with developmental deformities (such as those due to accidents, infection, disease, tumors, or aging). In some instances, reconstructive plastic surgery is mainly cosmetic in nature, with the goal of making the patient feel more comfortable in society, while in other instances, it may be medically necessary. Today, due to improved treatment options for so many disfiguring conditions, the emotional and physical results of the damage to your body by disease or trauma are very different from what they were in the past. The specific type of surgery will be determined in meetings with Dr. Lewis based on such factors as your age and health, severity of the situation, your tolerance of certain medications, procedures or therapies and your own personal preferences.</p>
